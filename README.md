This project focuses on predicting house prices using a linear regression model.
The dataset includes various house features, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, and feature selection was based on relevance to price prediction. 
The model was trained and evaluated on the cleaned dataset, providing insights into its predictive accuracy. 
This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a predictive model using real-world data.
